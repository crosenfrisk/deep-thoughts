  ## Installation
  The site is deployed by Heroku, and the database is MongoDB Atlas. If you would like to clone or fork the repo and play with the application on your local device, please do so, and then run production and development branches from your code editor. Be sure to install all dependencies, running `npm i` for all levels of the app. Scripts in package.json will run automatically run front and back-end servers when you `npm run develop` from main in your terminal, using npm package `concurrently`.

  ## Usage
  This application is a model of a social media interface using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The CSS isn't beautiful, but the page functions well. Logged in users can add friends, write thoughts, and add comments to other's thoughts. Users who are not logged in are encouraged to sign up. While the page may look like it has clickable links, all the components generate within the single-page application!
